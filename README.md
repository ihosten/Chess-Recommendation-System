# ChessRecommendatationSystem
Chess model that predicts the next best move/sub-optimal moves

The boardstate notebook uses an object recognition model trained in ´PieceDetector.ipynb´ to detect the board setup of a chessgame image.

Using the combination of a recommender system and genetic algorithm an optimal next move is suggested.
